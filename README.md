# React Project (Vite)

This is a minimal Vite + React project scaffold.

Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16) and npm installed. On Windows, use the installer from https://nodejs.org/ or use nvm-windows.

Install and run (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Jagan_Aksh\reactProject
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Next steps

- Add components in `src/`
- Add routing with `react-router` if needed
- Convert to TypeScript by renaming files and installing types
